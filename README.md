# My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io). This was built for the MobileMonday & IBM API First Hackathon. This app provides a dashboard for viewing images and data generated by our Unity simulation. https://github.com/zcaceres/watson-search-and-rescue

This file should be served with ngrok, and the Unity simulator needs the correct ngrok address in order to communicate with the dashboard via HTTP.
